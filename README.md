## Welcome to the Bookstore Laravel Project!
This web application is made using Laravel framework and runs as an online bookstore. Our platform facilitates the browsing and purchase of books, however, support for transactions is currently lacking as a virtual account system has not been implemented. But the amount of the simulated checkout will be displayed in the database. Below is a detailed description of the entire project:

+ **Author:** 
    **Jianfeng Han (SD2A)** and **Kim Fui Leung (SD2A)**<br>

+ **Student Number:** 
    **D00251825** (Jianfeng Han) and **D00234545** (Kim Fui Leung)<br>

## Web page description and function introduction
 + **Home page:** The homepage features dynamic scrolling subtitles and engaging text content designed to provide visitors with a quick overview of the services offered by the platform.<br>
 + **Book Browse, Search, and Sort:** The website offers an intuitive browsing experience where users can easily search for books and sort them using price and publication date. It is also possible to use search functions including (search for book title, price, type, etc.) This function ensures that users can find exactly the book they are looking for quickly and efficiently.<br>
 + **Comments and ratings functionalityï¼š** The system supports a strong comment and rating system. Users and administrators can comment on books and rate them on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. In addition, the system aggregates these ratings to arrive at a final average score for each book, helping other users make informed decisions based on varying user feedback.<br>
 + **User Authentication:** The system provides access levels to enhance security and user experience:
    - Visitors can browse books but need to register to purchase.
    - Registered users can purchase books, view purchase history, and participate in rating and reviewing books.
    - Administrators can access advanced features including book management, ratings and reviews, set book quantities, view detailed user information and purchase history, and delete user reviews and registered users.<br>
 + **User Detail:** Administrators have the ability to view detailed purchase records and user information, enabling effective management and oversight of platform activity.<br>
 + **Shopping Cart:** The system imposes a purchase limit of 10 copies per book per user per transaction. Users also have the option to purchase multiple different books during a single checkout process.<br>
 + **Payment Functionality:** While the checkout process includes a simulation that displays the total price, actual payment processing is not implemented,but the total price is displayed in the database, allowing for demonstration purposes without real transactions.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
